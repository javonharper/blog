Over my time as a software developer and someone who's interests have been piqued by the recent minimalism lifestyle and art movement I've noticed some things. People, like things to be clean, neat, organized, and simple to understand.

There's an old rule to being a boyscout that I'm going to paraphrase as "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it" And I use this as a rule for my life. I was never a boyscout but the message resonates with me every day. I use it to help me navigate the following tasks:

- Keeping my workspace neat and tidy before starting and after leaving work.
- Keeping my kitchen clean after cooking a mean.
- If I'm writing software, I like to tidy up any files that I might touch .
- When weightlifting I make sure to unrack my weights and clean down the equipment for the next person.

Basically any spot that I mess up, I try to make a point to do an equal or greater amount of tidying. 

There's an inherent chaos in everyday life. A tendency for things to get lost, moved, displaced, and soiled. We come home and fling our pants off on the ground. We eat and cook food at home and put the dishes in the sink without washing them that night. ALL, if not every action, deserves some action that sort of cleans up after the previous one. 

The big takeaway for me is that I now think of things as two-factor. This task that makes me accomplish something I really want to do means that I have to clean it up. If I want to edit this file that runs a web application, I need to do some cleaning up related to it. If I want to cook a big meal, I need to wash some dishes. 

I'm not saying that I always clean after the chaos. Most of the times I have set moments when I do general tidying up. Doing it whenever I was being productive would not be a great use of my time. So for example, for 10 minutes after every workday I decompress by doing mindless tasks. I wash dishes for no longer than 5 minutes, throw some clothes in the washing machine, and pick up my pants I flung on the floor.

These incremental sessions help keep my physical and mental space clear from distraction.
